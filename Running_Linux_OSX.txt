* Troubleshooting *

- If you see something like "Cannot create case: javafx/scene/paint/Color" it is an indication that Java FX
  is not being found.
  Confirm that the file $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext/jfxrt.jar exists. If it does not exist, return to the Java
  setup steps above.
- If you see something like "An illegal reflective access operation has occurred" it is an indication that
  the wrong version of Java is being used to run Autopsy.
  Check the version of Java reported in the ~/.autopsy/dev/var/log/messages.log file. It should contain lines that looks like:
    Java; VM; Vendor    = 1.8.0_232; OpenJDK 64-Bit Server V 25.232-b10; BellSoft
    Runtime             = OpenJDK Runtime Environment 1.8.0_232-BellSoft-b10
    Java Home           = /usr/lib/jvm/bellsoft-java8-amd64/jre

  If your messages.log file indicates that Java 8 is not being used:
  (a) confirm that you have a version of Java 8 installed and
  (b) confirm that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set correctly:
      % echo $JAVA_HOME
      
- If you see something like "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified." it is an indication 
  that Gatekeeper is running and is stopping a file from being executed.  To fix this open a new terminal window
  and enter the following command "sudo spctl --master-disable", you will be required to enter your password.  
  This will allow any program to be be downloaded from anywhere and executed.

* Limitations (Updated May 2018) *
- Timeline does not work on OS X
- Video thumbnails are not generated (need to get a consistent version of OpenCV)
- VHD and VMDK files not supported on OS X
